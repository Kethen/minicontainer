# The following directory is needed if the local admin wants to remove
# the setgid bit by following the steps listed in README.Debian.  Just
# creating the directory in postinst (in case systemd is not
# installed) and removing it again in postrm does not work, because
# postinst either removes a directory owned by systemd (even if empty)
# or leaves an unowned directory in case of any other init system is
# used. The situation would get even more tricky if the file hasn't
# been created because running under sysvinit and then the init system
# is switched (either by installing systemd-sysv or by switching the
# init system via boot parameters) without screen being reinstalled,
# i.e. screen's postinst not being called again. (And screen's init
# script can't handle that because it's no more run by systemd.)
